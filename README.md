# File-Compression-Using-Huffman-Coding

· Designed an algorithm that stores the contents of a text file in a new file with reduced size without losing any data which can be decompressed
to the original file using the algorithm which saves around 50% memory

· Implemented using functions like FreqencyTable, BuildHuffmanTree, GenerateCode,Encode(for compressing the file), Decode(for decompressing
to original file) and also analyses the sizes of input and compressed file and percentage of memory saved
